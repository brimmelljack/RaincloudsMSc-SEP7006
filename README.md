# RaincloudsMSc-SEP7006
The following repository contains the data file (.csv) and R Markdown file for the following: 1) installing and loading packages, 2) importing the data file in to RStudio, 3) pivoting/manipulating the data set, and 4) creating plots (bar, box and raincloud).

The intention for this repository was to aid teaching on a Research Methods module for the MSc Applied Sport & Exercise Psychology degree here at the University of Bolton. As a complimentary part of the course (i.e., non-compulsory), no RStudio, coding, data visualisation skills were required to pass the module and instead the skills could be used to include visualisations in the formative assessment (written lab report).
